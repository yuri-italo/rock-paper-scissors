# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Overview

This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The game is designed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course to help learners practice and reinforce their understanding of JavaScript basics.

## Purpose

The main objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience with JavaScript by building a functional game from scratch. It aims to solidify your understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## Features

- **Console-based Gameplay**: The game is played entirely in the browser's console.
- **Randomized Computer Choices**: The computer randomly selects its move from the three options (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **User Input**: The player inputs their choice via a prompt.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the scores for both the player and the computer over multiple rounds.
- **Round Results**: After each round, the game announces the winner and updates the scores accordingly.
- **Final Score Display**: After playing a specified number of rounds, the game displays the final scores.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core logic of the game is implemented in JavaScript.
- **HTML**: A basic HTML file is used to link the external JavaScript file and open the console for gameplay.

## Conclusion

Working on this Rock Paper Scissors project has been a fantastic way to strengthen my JavaScript skills. It gave me practical experience with essential programming concepts and helped me improve my problem-solving abilities. I highly recommend trying out this project if you want to get hands-on with JavaScript and have some fun coding!
